coarnotify
==========

.. py:module:: coarnotify

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This is the base of the `coarnotifypy` module.

   In here you will find
   a full set of model objects for all the Notify Patterns documented in
   https://coar-notify.net/specification/1.0.0/

   You will also find a client library that will allow you to send notifications
   to an inbox, and a server library that will allow you to write a service
   binding to your own systems to receive notifications via an inbox.

   There are also unit tests demostrating the various features of the system,
   integration tests which can be run against a remote inbox, and a
   stand-alone inbox you can use for local testing.
